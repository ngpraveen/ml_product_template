## A Machine Learning App Template

This app is created using a rather simple Random Forest ML model. The goal is to predict the class of Iris plant based on 4 features. The ML model is trained using the famous Iris data set. The app (web UI) is created using Gradio. The code is in the folder "gradioapp". I'm planning to switch from Gradio to FastAPI. The basic code using FastAPI is in "app" folder. However, it is missing HTML/CSS files, and adding them is in my to do list.  


This app is hosted here: [https://warm-spire-39227.herokuapp.com/](https://warm-spire-39227.herokuapp.com/ "here")


To do:
* Moving hard coded config params to config/config.yml file
* Currently the Web UI is run using Gradio. Replace it with FastAPI (partly done)
* Add more documentation (this document)


If you have any questions/comments, please do not hesitate to let me know.
